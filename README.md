# VSDI Code

This repository contains analysis code for Visual Signal/Imaging (VSDI) data.

The main analysis is currently implemented in a Jupyter notebook:
- `vsd_data_check.ipynb`

The notebook loads VSDI data, performs basic preprocessing and sanity checks,
and visualizes signal quality across trials.
